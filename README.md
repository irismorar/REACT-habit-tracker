# REACT-habit-tracker
Build a Habit Tracker where users can add, complete, or remove habits for each day.

Requirements:
1. A text input and a button to add a new habit.
2. A list of habits where each habit has:
    - A name
    - A "Complete" button (toggles completed state)
    - A "Delete" button (removes it from the list)
3. Display completed habits differently (e.g., strikethrough or color change).
